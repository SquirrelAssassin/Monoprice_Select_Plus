.ini files are for octoprint slicer



.profile are for cura 3.2.1 (monoprice support said to use this one but really any of the as long as you dont use the gcode any of them ship with)


below you will note my gcode spits out extra filament ... I just want to purge the hotend



glass bed with thermal tape under it (removed the buildtak crap it came with)
micro swiss hot end (removed the brass hot end it came with)
.4 nozzele
upgraded the cooling end to (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1025471)
3d printed supports and added rods (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1549403)
extended spool holder https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1652770
filement guide not sure which one
glass plate holders not sure which ones but it has screws and sucks recommend ones that hold it with pressure



Wood Attempts (stuff came from mg chemicals 1.75mm smells good)
attemp 1 (decent stringing but I think its to hot) 
215 nozzel
70 bed
40 print 
20 bottom
30 out
35 in
60 retraction speed
4.5 retraction distance
165 travel

attemp 2 (moderate strning but cooler at least)
200 nozzel (colder)
70 bed
40 print 
20 bottom
30 out
35 in
60 retraction speed
4.5 retraction distance
165 travel

attemp 3 (less stringing but I hear more retraction is bad but I dont like the idea of z hop as long as no grinding meh)
200 nozzel
70 bed
40 print 
20 bottom
30 out
35 in
55 retraction speed
5 retraction distance
165 travel

attemp 4 (even less stringing but I hear more retraction is bad but I dont like the idea of z hop as long as no grinding meh)
200 nozzel
70 bed
40 print 
20 bottom
30 out
35 in
50 retraction speed
6 retraction distance
165 travel

attemp 5 (hope is the slower-longer retaction creates more suction and less strining (really wish there were code to reduce pressure in nozzel or pause in a position before movement over or awaay from objects))
(success no stringing ...solid)
200 nozzel
70 bed
40 print 
20 bottom
30 out
35 in
45 retraction speed
7 retraction distance
165 travel
